## üìÑ Abstract

This project details the design and study of an analog circuit that produces a signal distortion effect from scratch. Such effects are widely used in the music industry with electric guitars. The design utilizes diode clipper circuits along with high-pass and low-pass filters to clip the signal and filter out unwanted noise. The circuit achieves both soft and hard distortion using common components like diodes, op-amps, resistors, and capacitors, without any microcontrollers. The output waveforms were observed through both LTspice simulations and a physical hardware prototype.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Theory of Operation

The core of this distortion pedal lies in **diode clipping circuits**. Diodes allow current to flow in one direction and have a forward voltage drop (e.g., 0.7‚ÄØV for silicon diodes). This property is exploited to "clip" the peaks of an audio signal, creating the distorted sound.

- **Soft Clipping**: Achieved by placing two diodes in parallel in the op-amp's feedback loop. This gently rounds the edges of the clipped waveform, producing a smoother, warmer, "tube-like" tone.
- **Hard Clipping**: Achieved by connecting two parallel diodes from the signal path to the ground. This aggressively chops off the signal peaks, resulting in a flat, square-wave-like signal with a harsher tone.

This circuit incorporates both soft and hard clipping stages to create a versatile distortion effect.
